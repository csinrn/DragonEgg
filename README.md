### About the Project
There are two kinds of item in this game, Item and Equipment. Item is for mission, and is not interactable but can be deleted, while Equipment is for rewarding, and is wearable and can not be deleted. Both of them are given by password, and the password is in 
*Assets/Resources/password.json*.
The first two action must be "getEgg" and "dragon", there are four kinds of different dragons with different initial ability points but with the same dragon picture, just check the password list to get more information.
For changing the item pic, go to itemList.json for changing the directory.

All the dragon pictures are from one of my classmate.
